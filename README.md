# Self-Driving Car Project in JavaScript

This project is a self-driving car simulation implemented entirely in JavaScript without using external libraries. The concept and lessons for this project are inspired by [Radu Mariescu-Istodor's tutorial available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY).

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a simulated road using HTML5 canvas, generate cars, and implement a basic neural network to train the car for self-driving behavior.

## Features

- **Canvas Road**: Renders a road environment using HTML5 canvas.
- **Car Rendering**: Draws cars within the simulated environment.
- **Neural Network**: Implements a basic neural network for training the car's autonomous driving behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ggenzone/self-driving.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser that supports HTML5 canvas.

## Usage

- Upon running the simulation, observe the car navigating the canvas environment.
- Experiment with the neural network parameters and settings to see how it affects the car's behavior.
